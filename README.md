# Artifact Helper

A helper for Valve's Artifact draft mode that displays an overlay on individual cards showing stats gathered from [Artibuff](https://www.artibuff.com/), tier lists (default tier list is Hyped's from [DrawTwo](https://drawtwo.gg/hypeds-limited-tier-list)) and custom annotations.

## Getting Started

Artifact Helper was built with Python 3.6.5 and is distributed via a self contained environment (built with [Pynsist](https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist)).
Currently only works on Windows. And tested only with windows 10.

### Prerequisites

* **Artifact running on borderless windowed mode**

* **Currently only works on Windows**

* **Only tested on 1080p resolution. First thing after release will be updating for other resolutions**

### Installing

Download and run the installer, _____ file .

It is also possible to build your own installation if you are an adventurer.

## How to use
After installation, simply launch the program via the start menu shortcut whenever you are going to draft.

If the program has properly loaded you will notice the Artifact Helper banner on top of the game. (remember that it won't work unless it is on **borderless windowed** mode).

## To do

* Test on different resolutions and environments
* Add an option to automatically scan the cards
* Deck tracker
* Advanced card recomendadion (based on synergy and mana curve)
