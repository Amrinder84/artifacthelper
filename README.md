# Artifact Helper

A helper for Valve's Artifact draft mode that displays an overlay on individual cards showing stats gathered from [Artibuff](https://www.artibuff.com/), tier lists (default tier list is Hyped's from [DrawTwo](https://drawtwo.gg/hypeds-limited-tier-list)) and custom annotations.

## Installing

Download latest [release](https://github.com/eoakley/artifacthelper/releases/latest).

Run the Artifact Helper executable file and follow the instructions.


### Prerequisites

* **[Microsoft Visual C++ 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587)**

* **Windows only**

* **Artifact running on borderless window mode**

* **Only works on 1080p resolution for now**

### Optional - Building it yourself

It is also possible to build your own installation if you are an adventurer. Instructions are on file "How to build.txt".

## How to use

After installation, simply launch the program via the start menu shortcut whenever you are going to draft.

When you are on a draft card selection screen click the "Launch Overlay" button and then switch back to your game.

If the program has properly loaded you will notice the Artifact Helper banner on top of the game. (remember that it won't work unless it is on **borderless window** mode).

Whenever you want to see the stats of the cards on display just click the "Scan Cards". After you finished the draft close the overlay window (click on the X on the top-right corner)

## How does it work

We trained a simple neural network using [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) to classify cards based on its artwork.

Using tier lists and historic data, we can show each card's win rate, pick rate and tier.

We built an interface using [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) to create the overlay on top of the game.

Artifact Helper was built with Python 3.6.5 and is distributed via a self contained environment (built with [Pynsist](https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist)).

Tested only on Windows 10.

## To do

* Add support for different resolutions and environments
* Add an option to automatically scan the cards
* Deck tracker
* Advanced card recomendadion (based on synergy and mana curve)
* Add custom options on the launcher
